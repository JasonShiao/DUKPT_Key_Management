# DUKPT Key Management
  * Practice DES and TDES implementation  
  * Practice DUKPT implementation  
  * Currently only ANSI X9.24-3-2009 is implemented
  * TODO: Support ANSI X9.24-3-2017 AES DUKPT
  
  > NOTE: This project is created with Visual Studio IDE

## DUKPT Originator
  Generate DUKPT key and encrypt a text

## DUKPT Receiver
  Use corresponding KSN to calculate the correct DUKPT key and decrypt the ciphertext
